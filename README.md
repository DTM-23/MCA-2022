# Week 1

The Theme that I chose to base my dataset around is Classical composers from the 19th Century. I choose this as it allows easy access to all 3 of the types of data required. 

Key challenges to working with music/music related data is the restrictions that copyright place upon selection of music that can be analysed. Music in a public domain is completely avalilble for the purposes of the assessment, but music which is more mainstream, and more well known, is more difficult and harder to access. This makes music which is desirable to analyse and curate less readily avaliable, and can lead to the study and analysis of music which may not be as interesting or harder to curate a dataset around. In relation to music from the 19th century performed by classical composers, this music is nigh impossible to find an original recording of due to the limitations of the time. There is recordings of people who perform the same pieces in modern day, but performances from the original composers are not avalible to analyse.
