# Dylans MCA project


# Week 1

The Theme that I chose to base my dataset around is Music from the Classical period. I choose this as it allows easy access to all 3 of the types of data required. 

Key challenges to working with music/music related data is the restrictions that copyright place upon selection of music that can be analysed. Music in a public domain is completely avalilble for the purposes of the assessment, but music which is more mainstream, and more well known, is more difficult and harder to access. This makes music which is desirable to analyse and curate less readily avaliable, and can lead to the study and analysis of music which may not be as interesting or harder to curate a dataset around. In relation to pieces from the classical period, this music can be difficult to find an accurate and original recording of due to the limitations of the time. There is recordings of people who perform the same pieces in modern day, but performances from the original composers are hard to find and to analyse. 

#  Week 2

During week 2, I imported a score into Musescore and corrected any issues that cropped up during the transcribing of the score. The piece was titled Sonata in C major by composer Ludwig AbeIlle. The main issues that occured with the transcribing of this particular score came with the lacking of dynamic markings that carried over from the original composition which led to a tedious process of implenting them step by step. 

Below is an example of the first fews bars of the piece before and then after it was transcribed by Musescore:

# Week 3

The link below will display my transcribed score online via the verovio viewer, along with some comments on the differences and advantages that XML and MEI files respectively have.

# Week 4


During Week 4, I used python code to analyse an excel file which I created using jsymbolic. I used the code to create interesting data regarding my own chosen score, such as a pitch histogram which is displayed below.

The Jsymbolic analysis of my piece also displayed intriguing results. I learned that the number of pitches within my piece was 31, along with the mean pitch being 65 and the most common pitch class being 7. 

I also uploaded the chord analysis of my piece into my data folder so it can be viewed. This file can be used for indepth analysis of individual chords, giving details on their step, octave, duration and note type.


# Week 5


This week saw the introduction of the importance of metadata. I went into my MEI file that I have been analysing across the last few weeks and annotaed the MEI header with key metadata regarding the piece. 

I modified and added in elements such as the editor of the sheet music that I used, as well as adding in the publisher along with a auth.url link to the copyright that the sheet music adheres to. Below is a link to the edited file.





# Week 7


 This week saw further editing of the week 5 file on enrich it with more metadata which was then displayed using the verovio viewer. CSS code was used to neatly format the metadata at the top of the piece to make it more readable. Below is a link to my edited score with the added metadata, I included an authority link to the copyright for the sheet music.

# Week 8


During week 8, I found classical piano pieces which I could then analyse in the form of a spectrograph in sonic visualiser.
