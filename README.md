# Dylans MCA project


# Week 1

The Theme that I chose to base my dataset around is Classical piano pieces. I choose this as it allows easy access to all 3 of the types of data required. 

Key challenges to working with music/music related data is the restrictions that copyright place upon selection of music that can be analysed. Music in a public domain is completely avalilble for the purposes of the assessment, but music which is more mainstream, and more well known, is more difficult and harder to access. This makes music which is desirable to analyse and curate less readily avaliable, and can lead to the study and analysis of music which may not be as interesting or harder to curate a dataset around. In relation to piano pieces from the 19th century performed by classical composers, this music can be difficult to find an accurate and original recording of due to the limitations of the time. There is recordings of people who perform the same pieces in modern day, but performances from the original composers are hard to find and to analyse. 

#  Week 2

During week 2, I can imported a score into Musescore and corrected any issues that cropped up during the transcribing of the score.


# Week 4


During Week 4, I used python code to analyse an excel file which I created using jsymbolic. I used the code to create interesting data regarding my own chosen score, such as a pitch histogram which is displayed below.

I also uploaded the chord analysis of my piece into my data folder so it can be viewed.
